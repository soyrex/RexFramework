          <p>the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm, where i had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. but as i was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing&mdash;at least, what untattooed parts might remain&mdash;i did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.</p>
